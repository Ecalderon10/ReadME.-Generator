##Description

ReadMe Generator was built in order to help users have a solid application to create their ReadME file with proper licensing
and structure to their ReadME's. 


1. When first approaching this project I began with installing package.json and package-lock.json
2. After making sure everything was properly installed I started to connect all my constants and their respective paths
3.Once I finished that, I moved onto building out the questions for the User to fill out to generate their ReadMe file
4. After creating the questions, I moved onto building out the proper functions to append and create the new file
5. This then lead me to creating the generateMarkDownFile to genarate their input into the proper format
6. Lastly, after creating this file I ran all functions and node neccessary to insure proper functionality for the User
